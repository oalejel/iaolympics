IA Olympics Real-Time Scoreboard
=================================

This web app is a realtime scoreboard for the International Academy (IA) Okma Campus Olympics.

The Olympics is a competition between the four classes at the IA - freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors. The competition consists of subcompetitions, called "events", in which representatives from each class compete in specialized activities. At the end of each event, a number of points is awarded to each class - a higher number is awarded for a better performance. The class which scores the most points overall wins.

The application consists of two components - a live updating scoreboard and a score entry interface.
